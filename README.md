Universal Sprite Sheet
======================

An attempt to consolidate all of the humanoid entries from the Liberated Pixel Cup, lpc.opengameart.org, into a single GIMP project, as well as to try and make most clothing accessible by either gender.

Online Version
==============
Guarav0 Has created an online version of the Universal Sprite Sheet, located at http://gaurav0.koding.com/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/

Abbreviations
=============

In trying to keep things organized, I've employed a few different abbreviations to keep the filenames from running out of control.  They are:
 - sc: spellcast
 - th: thrust
 - wc: walkcycle
 - sl: slash
 - sh: shoot
 - hu: hurt

Collaborating
=============

If you'd like to help out, please do so!  I've worked with @joewhite to hammer out some basic guidelines:
 - Edit the .png files, not the .xcf.  Once the pull is merged, a maintainer (@makrohn) will fold the .png files into the .xcf
 - As with code, try to keep pull requests grouped thematically - eg, "skintonefixes" "suitandtie" "blackshoes" so they can be evaluated separately.
